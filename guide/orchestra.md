# Orchestra

These libraries encompass more than just one orchestral section.

Product bundles, which are composed of smaller products (usually divided into strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion) are not mentioned here, but their component products are covered in the other pages of this guide. The bundles are often more comprehensive than the orchestral packages listed here, allowing for more detailed arrangements.

**BBC Symphony Orchestra**  
Spitfire Audio - Sample player included  
*[Discover](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/bbc-symphony-orchestra-discover/) $50 or FREE / [Core](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/bbc-symphony-orchestra-core/) $450 / [Professional](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/bbc-symphony-orchestra-professional/) $1000*

**STRENGTHS:**  
Includes a comprehensive selection of instruments and articulations with a great sound. It's easy to upgrade to a higher tier after purchasing.

**WEAKNESSES:**  
The legato scripting is decent but not best-in-class.

**DETAILS:**  
This is one of those rare libraries where every single tier is impressively useful for its target audience. Official comparison chart [here](https://d1t3zg51rvnesz.cloudfront.net/p/images/cms2/985/desktop-bbcso_compare-15-may.jpg).
- **Discover** - Meant for people who are just starting in orchestral music and may not know if it's something they want to invest in. This is an outstanding deal (you can get it for free!) that shockingly includes individually recorded sections. Articulations are *very* limited but it's hard to complain at this price point.
- **Core** - A fantastic-value orchestral package for anyone. It includes an impressive number of articulations, including legato. If you're not sure how you can jump into detailed orchestral writing, this is an awesome purchase. Only includes one mic position<sup>[[?]](../more/glossary.md#mic-positions)</sup>, but you can always upgrade later.
- **Professional** - Meant for people who want that extra level of detail and customization provided by extra mic positions and a few additional instruments.

**Nucleus (The Orchestral Core)**  
Audio Imperia - Works with the free Kontakt Player  
*[Lite](https://www.audioimperia.com/products/nucleus-lite-edition) $100 / [Full](https://www.audioimperia.com/products/nucleus) $450*

**STRENGTHS:**  
A great-sounding library that includes all of the essential articulations that someone just starting out with orchestral music would need. Legato scripting is excellent. The individually recorded sections make it stand out from some of the other all-in-one orchestral starter kits.

**WEAKNESSES:**  
Some patches lack legato, and the selection of articulations isn't exactly exhaustive. This library won't be the be-all and end-all for your orchestral sample needs (but to be fair, it's not trying to be). The Lite version is rather limited in usefulness for orchestral music.

Orchestral Tools - Works with the free SINE Player  
*[Inspire](https://www.orchestraltools.com/store/collections/inspire-1) / [Inspire 2](https://www.orchestraltools.com/store/collections/inspire-2) each €400*

**STRENGTHS:**  
Samples pulled from the well-loved Berlin Series. Provides the bare necessities for orchestral composition. A great foundation to build up from.

**WEAKNESSES:**  
One mic position<sup>[[?]](../more/glossary.md#mic-positions)</sup>. Can't access every individual orchestral section.

**Metropolis Ark series**  
Orchestral Tools - Works with the free Kontakt Player

**STRENGTHS:**  
These collections sound fantastic. Each product includes sample content that is specially catered to the product's theme. The result? An expansive variety of recorded articulations that cover a number of niche use cases.

**WEAKNESSES:**  
Each product is relatively niche. 

**DETAILS:**
- **Metropolis Ark 1** - Meant for a traditional epic sound, great for bombastic tracks. *mf* to *fff* dynamics. This is by far the most versatile entry in the collection.
- **Metropolis Ark 2** - Meant for an powerful but quiet sound, great for more subdued tracks. *ppp* to *mp* dynamics.
- **Metropolis Ark 3** - Meant for an aggressive, rhythmic sound. Includes lots of atonal and repetition articulations, plus a huge variety of epic percussion.
- **Metropolis Ark 4** - Meant for a dramatic, powerful, and focused sound. *ppp* to *fff* dynamics.
- **Metropolis Ark 5** - Meant for drama, with various specialized ensembles and articulations (runs, Shepard tones, FX, etc).

**Jaeger (Essential Modern Orchestra)**  
Audio Imperia - Works with the free Kontakt Player  
*$600 / [More info](https://www.audioimperia.com/products/jaeger-essential-modern-orchestra)*

**STRENGTHS:**  
One of the best packages for those wanting to dive into trailer music, but more versatile than just that one genre. Lovely legato scripting. Outstanding vocalist patch.

**WEAKNESSES:**  
Only the most basic articulations are provided. Legato is not available for every instrument. Woodwinds and 2nd violins are not included.

**Albion series**  
Spitfire Audio - Works with the free Kontakt Player  
*[ONE](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/albion-one/) / [Uist](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/albion-iv-uist/) / [Tundra](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/albion-tundra/) / [Neo](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/albion-neo) each $450*

**STRENGTHS:**  
Useful and great-sounding collection of instruments including more than just orchestral instruments (most volumes contain mutated samples, loops, and percussion).

**WEAKNESSES:**  
Individual instrument sections are often unavailable - these libraries will not give you finer control over the orchestra.

**DETAILS:**
- **Albion ONE** - The vanilla volume, aimed toward a traditional epic sound.
- **Albion IV Uist** - An aleatoric volume designed to meet all of your needs for orchestral effects.
- **Albion Tundra** - Aimed toward the pristine, ethereal sound of an orchestra playing extremely quietly.
- **Albion Neo** - A volume with smaller section sizes, aimed toward a modern, intimate sound.
